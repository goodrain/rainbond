## What is Rainbond?
Rainbond is 100% open-source, offers a serverless experience, and allows you to easily manage containerized applications without needing to understand Kubernetes. It is an integrated application management platform suitable for private deployment.

ðŸš€ One-line Definition: Rainbond = Heroku-like Experience + Native Kubernetes Support + Self-hosted Capabilities

## Why Rainbond?

### Positioning Differences with Mainstream Platforms
| **Platform Type**      | Representative Products           | Rainbond's Differentiation                    |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Developer-friendly PaaS** | Heroku, Vercel           | â–¶ Self-hosted Support â–¶ Full K8s Compatibility |
| **K8s Native Tools**   | Rancher, Devtron         | â–¶ Application-level Abstraction â–¶ Zero YAML Experience â–¶ Complex Application Topology â–¶ Offline Environment Support |
| **Self-hosted Solutions** | CapRover, Coolify        | â–¶ Enterprise Multi-tenancy â–¶ Hybrid Cloud Management |

### ðŸŽ¯ What Pain Points Does It Solve?
**Developer Perspective**
- "I need to deploy a system with 20 microservices, but don't want to study K8s configs for each component"
- "The configuration differences between production and test environments make every deployment risky"
- "How to quickly deliver complex systems in customer's offline environment?"

**Ops/Platform Admin Perspective**
- "Need to give developers autonomy while ensuring cluster stability"
- "Traditional application cloud-native transformation costs too much"
- "Unified application management across multi/hybrid cloud environments"

### ðŸš€ Core Capabilities

- **Install Enterprise Software Like Mobile Apps**: Through the built-in application marketplace, various published microservice application templates support one-click installation and upgrades, even for systems with 100+ microservices.

- **Containerization Without Dockerfile and YAML**: The platform automatically recognizes multiple development languages like Java, Python, Golang, NodeJS, PHP, .NetCore, etc., completing build and deployment through a wizard-like process without writing Dockerfile or YAML.

- **Full Application Lifecycle Management**: Serverless experience where regular developers can manage and maintain applications and components without learning, including start, stop, build, update, auto-scaling, gateway policy management, etc., with non-invasive microservice architecture.

- **Microservice Modular Assembly**: Business components running on Rainbond support modular dependency orchestration, one-click publishing as reusable application templates, enabling business component accumulation and reuse.

### Who Is It Designed For?
ðŸ‘©ðŸ’» Developer Users
- Need URL access within 5 minutes from code
- Want cloud-native capabilities without learning K8s
- Zero configuration differences between dev and prod environments

ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’¼ Platform Managers
- Traditional application cloud-native transformation
- Building internal PaaS platforms
- Achieving unified hybrid cloud management

### âœ¨ Differentiating Highlights Comparison
| Dimension          | Traditional Approach              | Rainbond Approach                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Deployment Complexity** | Requires K8s experts to write YAML | Visual orchestration, auto-generates K8s resources |
| **Environment Consistency** | Manual maintenance of multiple configs | Environment config templating, one-click deployment |
| **Delivery Form** | Docs + scripts + manual deployment | Self-contained app template (code + config) |
| **Skill Requirements** | Need full container/K8s stack skills | Operation interface based on application model abstraction |

## Getting Started

## Installation

### Minimum Requirements
- Linux OS (CentOS 7+/Ubuntu 18.04+)
- 2 CPU cores / 8GB RAM / 50GB disk space

### 3-Minute Quick Installation
You only need to execute the following command to run a container and quickly experience the full functionality of Rainbond. For more installation options, refer to [Installation and Upgrade](https://www.rainbond.io/docs/quick-start/quick-install).

```bash
curl -o install.sh https://get.rainbond.com && IMGHUB_MIRROR=rainbond bash ./install.sh
```

After the command is executed successfully, open a browser and enter `http://<IP>:7070` to access the platform and start deploying applications. `<IP>` is the IP address you selected or entered when running the script.
