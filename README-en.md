## What is Rainbond ?

Rainbond is a cloud native multi cloud application management platform, which is easy to use and does not need to understand containers, kubernetes and underlying complex technologies. It supports the management of multiple kubernetes clusters and the management of the whole life cycle of enterprise applications. The main functions include application development environment, application market, micro service architecture, application delivery, application operation and maintenance, application level multi cloud management, etc.

## Why Rainbond ?

Kubernetes serves as a system for managing containerized applications. It provides a basic mechanism for the deployment, maintenance and expansion of applications. However, when users transform their traditional applications to cloud native applications, they will encounter the following problems when using kubernetes:

- Container deployment of enterprise applications
- Kubernetes has a steep learning curve
- How can deployed applications be delivered and upgraded in other kubernetes environments

Rainbond follows **the design concept of application centered** and unifies the technologies related to containers, kubernetes and underlying infrastructure, so that users can focus on the business itself and avoid spending a lot of learning and management energy on technologies other than the business.
- Rainbond supports [one-step transformation of enterprise applications into cloud native applications](https://www.rainbond.com/docs/#2%E4%B8%80%E6%AD%A5%E5%B0%86%E4%BC%A0%E7%BB%9F%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8%E5%8F%98%E6%88%90%E4%BA%91%E5%8E%9F%E7%94%9F%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8)
- Rainbond does not need to know about kubernetes, and can [quickly install kubernetes through the web interface](https://www.rainbond.com/docs/quick-start/quick-install#%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8E-web-%E7%95%8C%E9%9D%A2%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85), supporting the management of multiple kubernetes clusters
- Rainbond supports multi cloud delivery, private delivery, SaaS delivery, offline delivery, personalized delivery, application market, etc., and realizes the automation of various delivery processes.

## Rainbond function and architecture

![Rainbond-Arch](https://grstatic.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/case/2022/03/17/16474283190784.jpg)

Rainbond manages enterprise applications based on public cloud, private cloud and self built kubernetes, and supports [application level multi cloud management](https://www.rainbond.com/docs/#%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8%E7%BA%A7%E5%A4%9A%E4%BA%91%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86).

Rainbond Support [application lifecycle management](https://www.rainbond.com/docs/#%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8%E5%85%A8%E7%94%9F%E5%91%BD%E5%91%A8%E6%9C%9F%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86), that is, one-stop connection of development, architecture, delivery and operation and maintenance.

Components in Rainbond are independent, reusable, extensible and integrated units that support different granularity and version management. Components can be reused in different application scenarios. Components themselves can be upgraded iteratively. The accumulated components are stored in the component library, realizing [the accumulation and reuse of enterprise digital capabilities](https://www.rainbond.com/docs/#3%E5%AE%9E%E7%8E%B0%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%97%E5%8C%96%E8%83%BD%E5%8A%9B%E7%A7%AF%E7%B4%AF%E5%92%8C%E5%A4%8D%E7%94%A8).
